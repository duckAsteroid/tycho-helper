Tycho helper plugins
=====================

These plugins are intended to make it easier to work with Tycho based builds. There are several basic functionalities implemented:
* A tycho project nature to distinguish tycho based projects from other Maven projects
* An Eclipse builder to validate that the key POM and manifest attributes are in sync (mark as error in POM if not)
    * POM artifactId & version = Bundle
* A shortcut to "enable tycho" on a PDE project
    * Add the Maven project nature etc.
    * Run the POM generator on the project (to create the POM)
    * Add the tycho project nature (to enable support of this plugin)
